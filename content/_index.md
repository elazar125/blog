## Welcome to my site!

Hi! I'm Ezra - dad, juggler, board game enthusiast. And also I write code sometimes.

Check out my blog if you want to hear about the few thoughts I got around to writing, and take a gander at my hobby code if you're into that.

I'll probably write mostly about tech, maybe a bit about other things that cross my mind. Nothing I write here is about or endorsed by my employer.
